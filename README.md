# ConfigTools

Tools for managing application config in Elixir apps

Implements a [Config.Provider](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/Config.Provider.html) that will dump your config to stdout, allowing you to use it for approval testing.

# TODO

- [ ] example app(s) for integration testing and documentation
- [ ] a way to mask secrets
- [ ] flip dump / approve or make them separate commands - dump should come into the foreground more as a feature
- [ ] mix task(s0 entrypoint
